## Knowledge Should Not Be Our God

In today's world, we often find ourselves in relentless pursuit of knowledge, productivity, and self-improvement—especially at a young age when we are just starting our professional journeys. We chase validation, admire brilliant individuals, and strive to prove our worth. This pursuit is undoubtedly a beautiful thing, and there is value in it. However, it is important to recognize that we must continuously evolve and adapt.

Through this ongoing process of growth and change, it becomes evident that knowledge and self-improvement should not be seen as ultimate goals or idols. They will never provide complete satisfaction. The drive to tackle difficult challenges, spend countless hours solving complex problems, and achieve what others might not even attempt can become an addiction—an addiction to knowledge, to gaining experience, and to proving value through actions. It often feels like a game, where we are constantly earning experience points and developing our "character."

However, maintaining a sustainable pace is crucial. The pursuit of knowledge is endless; there will always be more to learn, more to improve. Perhaps the greatest challenge is recognizing when to pause, take a breath, and be present in different environments. It's about finding balance—being proactive without being consumed. 

As the saying goes, it's better to **"be the dog, not the tail,"** taking control rather than being led by an insatiable quest for more.
